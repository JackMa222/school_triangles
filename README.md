# Triangle Identificaiton Software

This is a very, very basic and beginner piece of software written to achieve a basic scenario

### triangles.py (Triangle Class)
Has the triangle class with a variety of function, mainly related to determining validity and triangle types

### app.py (Basic Flask Application)
A basic flask application to enter the three sides and returns an output of the triangle type

### csvTri.py (CSV Reader/Writer)
Will take an input csv file (tri_sides.csv), and output the sides, validity and triangle type to a new csv file in csv/

*Creators note: I do understand that the majority of this may be best built in another language (i.e. using JavaScript to create an equivalent website to app.py but handle all on the client side), but Python is the required language of choice for this project.*
